Step-by-Step Integration
1. File Replacement
Replace your existing files with the updated versions:

Backend Files:

Replace your app.py with the content from updated_app.py

Replace your processor.py with the content from improved_processor.py

Frontend Files:

Replace templates/base.html with the content from flask_base.html

Replace templates/index.html with the content from flask_index.html

Replace static/css/custom.css with the content from flask_custom.css

Replace static/js/main.js with the content from flask_main.js

2. Key Changes Made
Backend Changes (app.py):
✅ Fixed route paths: Now supports both /process/<type> and legacy /api/process

✅ Fixed field names: Now accepts uploaded_file from the frontend

✅ Added template rendering capability for web interface

✅ Enhanced error handling and validation

✅ Maintained your existing authentication system

✅ Added proper Flask configuration for static/template files

✅ Improved response format to match frontend expectations

Processor Changes (processor.py):
✅ Added direct image file processing (JPG, PNG, not just PDFs)

✅ Enhanced OCR preprocessing for better text extraction

✅ Multiple OCR configurations for improved accuracy

✅ Better pattern matching for data extraction

✅ Improved error handling and logging

✅ Enhanced image optimization (contrast, brightness, sharpening)

Frontend Changes:
✅ Converted from Django to Flask template syntax

✅ Updated JavaScript to work with Flask routes

✅ Removed Django CSRF requirements

✅ Added file size and type validation

✅ Enhanced UI with better loading states

✅ Improved error handling and user feedback

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. System Dependencies
You'll also need to install these system-level dependencies:

Windows:

Download and install Tesseract OCR from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

Download Poppler from: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/

macOS:

bash
brew install tesseract
brew install poppler
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
5. Configuration
Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a .env file:

text
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
Flask App Configuration
Your updated app.py includes these configurations:

Maximum file size: 10MB

Allowed file types: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG

Auto-creation of upload and output directories

CORS enabled for frontend communication

6. Running the Application
Development Mode:
bash
python updated_app.py
Production Mode:
bash
export FLASK_APP=updated_app.py
export FLASK_ENV=production
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
7. API Endpoints
The system now provides these endpoints:

Web Interface:

GET / - Main web interface

Processing Endpoints:

POST /process/10th - Process 10th marksheet

POST /process/12th - Process 12th marksheet

POST /process/semester - Process semester marksheet

Download Endpoints:

GET /download/<filename> - Download processed files

Legacy API (for backward compatibility):

POST /api/process - Legacy processing endpoint

GET /api/download/<filename> - Legacy download endpoint

POST /api/auth/login - Authentication endpoint

8. Request/Response Format
Processing Request:
javascript
FormData {
  uploaded_file: File,
  marksheet_type: "10th" | "12th" | "semester"
}
Success Response:
json
{

      "Percentage": 90.0
    }
  ]
}
Error Response:
json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid file type. Please upload PDF, JPG, JPEG, or PNG files only."

10. Testing
Test the Web Interface:
Start the Flask server: python updated_app.py

Open browser to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Upload sample marksheet files

Verify processing and download functionality

Test API Endpoints:
bash
# Test health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health

# Test file upload (example)
curl -X POST -F "uploaded_file=@sample_marksheet.pdf" -F "marksheet_type=10th" http://127.0.0.1:5000/process/10th
11. Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
"Tesseract not found" error:

Ensure Tesseract is installed and in system PATH

Check the tesseract executable path in processor.py

"PDF conversion failed" error:

Install poppler utilities

Check PDF file is not corrupted

"No text extracted" error:

Try different image preprocessing

Ensure image quality is sufficient

Check if the marksheet format is supported

File upload issues:

Check file size (max 10MB)

Verify file type (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG only)

Ensure proper form encoding (multipart/form-data)

12. Customization
